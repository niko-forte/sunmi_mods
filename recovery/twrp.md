# TWRP FOR SUNMI V2 PRO (SD425)

After a while the custom recovery twrp was completed

The installation process is the same as when you install [this](https://github.com/niko-forte/sunmi_mods/blob/main/custom_rom/Sunmi%20V2%20Pro/stock_mod.md) custom com, except that instead of selecting boot/devinfo/system you would only select the recovery partition
(or the devinfo partition if you did not previously install the custom rom)

 [Here](https://www.mediafire.com/file/ldt1y60vtg77m8r/twrp_3.3.1-0_v2pro.zip/file) is the download link (including the devinfo.bin file)
 which is the same as the one found in the rom
