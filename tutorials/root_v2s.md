## PLEASE PROCEED WITH CAUTION WHEN FOLLOWING THESE STEPS

In order to root the Sunmi V2s you must flash the boot_27.0.img
(download link: https://www.mediafire.com/file/x2rcf9srrbi9wo7/RootSunmiV2S.zip/file)
in fastboot mode
Make sure you have the drivers correctly installed, if you don't have them download them from here:
https://www.mediafire.com/file/qw6z0egl0t6p44f/usb_driver_r13-windows.zip/file
you can do this in both Linux and Windows with their respective .sh or .cmd
In the same .zip file is the stock boot.img without root in case you want to remove the root or use another root method

If you don't have adb/fastboot installed you can download it from here:
