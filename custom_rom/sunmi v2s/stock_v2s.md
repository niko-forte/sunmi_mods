# Stock Rom for Sunmi v2s (all variants)

If you own a Sunmi v2s locked by some company and without Google services
you can download [here](https://www.mediafire.com/file/ekaa0fbedtpcw17/sunmi_v2s_android11.zip/file) a stock rom free of the ties of some companies and with Google services ready to use

### To install it you must unlock the bootloader, you can see the tutorial on how to do it [here](https://github.com/niko-forte/sunmi_mods/blob/main/tutorials/unlock_bl_v2s.md)
This rom has Android version 11
The good thing about this ROM is that it can work on variants that have NFC as well as variants that do not have NFC
It can also convert variants that do not have Google services into variants that do have them
It was tested on a variant with a serial number without Google services (see screenshot above) and there was no problem at all
Also in the installation package I include a very slightly modified version without the Sunmi Store in case you want and without certain Sunmi applications
The same ROM installer gives you the option to choose if you want to have the Sunmi Store or not
Likewise the ROM installer gives you the option to choose if you want to get root with Magisk

## How do I install it?

Simply run the python file, it is compatible with Windows and Linux operating systems (macOS was not tested)
It simply requires having [python](https://www.python.org/) and fastboot installed
