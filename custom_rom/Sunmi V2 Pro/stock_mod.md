# WARNING WARNING!!!

## Because there are 2 or more versions of Sunmi V2 Pro boards, I must tell you this, the released firmware is only compatible with V1 boards, not V2 boards. Installing it on this board may cause it to boot incorrectly, such as with the screen flipped, the touch not working or not booting at all. Before installing, make sure that the board you are installing it on is a V1 (Here is a reference image)

### Bugs??:

- Audio recording?
You could say that it is a bug although
it is not, the screen recording app* also has an audio recording feature
but it does not record, nor does it record audio from the screen recorder itself
but it is not a rom error, the device does not have an integrated microphone

- Voice calls??
Since as it was said that the device does not have a microphone
it is impossible to make calls, for that same reason it was decided not to add a dialer app
but if you want to install it on your own here is a link to download and install the dialer app
(remember to give it the necessary permissions)
