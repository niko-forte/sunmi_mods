# Bugs:

Audio recording? You could say that it is a bug although
it is not, the screen recording app* also has an audio recording feature
but it does not record, nor does it record audio from the screen recorder itself
but it is not a rom error, the device does not have an integrated microphone


Voice calls ??? Since as it was said that the device does not have a microphone
it is impossible to make calls, for that same reason it was decided not to add a dialer app
but if you want to install it on your own here is a link to download and install the dialer app
(remember to give it the necessary permissions)
