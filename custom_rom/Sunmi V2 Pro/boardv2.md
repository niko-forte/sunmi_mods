# Finally available...
# Custom rom for Sunmi V2 Pro (Board V2)

After a long wait, the custom for the v2 board is finally available
List of changes (similar to the board v1 rom):

# Changes in version 1.0

### Additions:
- (Unnecessary Sunmi apps removed)
- The following apps were updated:
- Google Chrome
- Google Maps
- Gmail
- Play Store

### The following apps were added (They were not included in the system)

- Youtube
- WPS Office
- Calendar (Yes, the system did not have a calendar app)
- Contacts apps (Yes, the system did not have one either)
- Clock app (and to set an alarm)
- Music player
- Screen recorder*
- Google Keep (notes app)
- File manager
- Barcode/QR reader
- The stock launcher was changed to a more minimalist one
- The kernel is already pre-rooted with Magisk 27.0 (Optionally including a file without magisk)

### Bugs??:

- Audio recording?
You could say that it is a bug although
it is not, the screen recording app* also has an audio recording feature
but it does not record, nor does it record audio from the screen recorder itself
but it is not a rom error, the device does not have an integrated microphone

- Voice calls??
Since as it was said that the device does not have a microphone
it is impossible to make calls, for that same reason it was decided not to add a dialer app
but if you want to install it on your own here is a link to download and install the [dialer](https://www.mediafire.com/file/odi1djr9vl9wns9/Dialer.apk/file) app
(remember to give it the necessary permissions)
