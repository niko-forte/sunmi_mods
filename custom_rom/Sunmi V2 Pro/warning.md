# WARNING WARNING!!!

## Because there are 2 or more versions of Sunmi V2 Pro boards, I must tell you this, the released firmware is only compatible with V1 boards, not V2 boards. Installing it on this board may cause it to boot incorrectly, such as with the screen flipped, the touch not working or not booting at all. Before installing, make sure that the board you are installing it on is a V1 (Here is a reference image)

# How do I know what version of board I have?

### You simply have to disassemble your device very carefully, using the image above as a guide, you will know what version of the board you have.

Certain things may be incompatible with each other (it will be specified what thing)
To check for yourself what version of the board you have, you must disassemble your device and the board should tell you

We are not responsible if you damage your device by not reading the warnings of the different boards

Certain things are compatible between both boards, such as the twrp recovery, but other things are not, such as the custom rom

Please you are strongly requested to check your motherboard version before installing the custom rom, as failure to do so may permanently damage your device.
