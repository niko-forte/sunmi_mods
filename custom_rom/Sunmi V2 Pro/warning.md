# WARNING WARNING!!!

## Because there are 2 or more versions of Sunmi V2 Pro boards, I must tell you this, the released firmware is only compatible with V1 boards, not V2 boards. Installing it on this board may cause it to boot incorrectly, such as with the screen flipped, the touch not working or not booting at all. Before installing, make sure that the board you are installing it on is a V1 (Here is a reference image)
